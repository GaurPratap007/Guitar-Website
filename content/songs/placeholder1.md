[G]Flowing through [D/F#]valleys we [Em7]go
Under the [C]bridges of [G]stone
The [C]evening wind [G]whispers your [D]name
[Em]Carried by [C]rivers back [D]home

# Chorus
[G]Oh, these [D]rivers, they [Em]know
Our [C]secrets and [G]sorrows we [D]stow
[Em]Guide me to [C]shores I have [G]known
[C]Bring me back [D]home
